#Introduction to tidy data

---
#Tidy data
There are three interrelated rules that make a data set tidy:
- Each variable must have its own column
- Each observation must have its own row
- Each value must have its own cell

---
# Two things we will use across all our workshop:
.pull-left[
![Image](img/magrittr.png)
]

.pull-right[
![Image](img/tibble.png)
]

---
# The %>% pipe

## Basic piping

  * `x %>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)`
  * `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
  * `x %>% f %>% g %>% h` is equivalent to `h(g(f(x)))`

### The argument placeholder

 * `x %>% f(y, .)` is equivalent to `f(y, x)`
 * `x %>% f(y, z = .)` is equivalent to `f(y, z = x)`

---
# The %>% pipe
## Example
```{r}
colMeans(subset(iris, Species == "setosa", select= -Species))
iris %>% 
  subset(Species == "setosa", select = -Species ) %>% 
  colMeans()
```

---
#The %>% pipe

- And one more reminder: Rstudio shortcut for the pipe is Ctrl+Shift+M
- Check more shortcuts at Tools -> Keyboard Shortcuts Help.

---
#Tibbles: A (new) way to organize data in R

### It never changes an input's type (i.e., no more `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`!).
    
```{r}
tibble(x = letters)
```
    
---
### This makes it easier to use with list-columns:
    
```{r}
tibble(x = 1:3, y = list(1:5, 1:10, 1:20))
```

---
### It never adjusts the names of variables:
  
```{r}
names(data.frame(`crazy name` = 1))
names(tibble(`crazy name` = 1))
```

---
### It evaluates its arguments lazily and sequentially:
  
```{r}
tibble(x = 1:5, y = x ^ 2)
```

  * It never uses `row.names()`. The whole point of tidy data is to 
    store variables in a consistent way. So it never stores a variable as 
    special attribute.
  
  * It only recycles vectors of length 1. This is because recycling vectors of greater lengths 
    is a frequent source of bugs.

---
# Tibbles vs data frames

The key differences between tibbles and data frames are: printing, subsetting, and recycling rules.

---
## Printing
When you print a tibble, it only shows the first ten rows and all the columns that fit on one screen. It also prints an abbreviated description of the column type:
    
```{r}
tibble(x = 1:1000, y = rep("a", 1000), z = sample(c(T,F),1000, rep=T))
```

---
## Subsetting

Tibbles are quite strict about subsetting. `[` always returns another tibble. Contrast this with a data frame: sometimes `[` returns a data frame and sometimes it just returns a vector:
    
```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = 3:1)
class(df1[, 1:2])
class(df1[, 1])

df2 <- tibble(x = 1:3, y = 3:1)
class(df2[, 1:2])
class(df2[, 1])
```

---
To extract a single column use `[[` or `$`:

```{r}
class(df2[[1]])
class(df2$x)
```

Tibbles are also stricter with `$`. Tibbles never do partial matching, and will throw a warning and return `NULL` if the column does not exist:

```{r, error = TRUE}
df <- data.frame(abc = 1)
df$a

df2 <- tibble(abc = 1)
df2$a
```

---
## Recycling

When constructing a tibble, only values of length 1 are recycled.  The first column with length different to one determines the number of rows in the tibble, conflicts lead to an error. 

```{r, error = TRUE}
tibble(a = 1, b = 1:3)
tibble(a = 1:3, b = 1)
tibble(a = 1:3, c = 1:2)
tibble(a = 1, b = integer())
tibble(a = integer(), b = 1)
```
---
## Recycling

This also extends to tibbles with *zero* rows, which is sometimes important for programming:
```{r, error = TRUE}
tibble(a = 1, b = integer())
tibble(a = integer(), b = 1)
```

# Data import!

---
# Three main packages of tidyverse for importing data

- [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr): delimited files
- [readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl): Excel files (.xls and .xlsx)
- [haven](https://github.com/hadley/haven): SPSS, Stata, SAS

Some advantages:

- Faster than alternatives
- StringsAsFactors=FALSE by default.
- Save the results as a tibble object.

---
# Reading data: readr

The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf)

readr supports seven file formats with seven read_ functions:

- read_csv(): comma separated (CSV) files
- read_tsv(): tab separated files
- read_delim(): general delimited files
- read_fwf(): fixed width files
- read_table(): tabular files where colums are separated by white-space.
- read_log(): web log files

An special case of read_delim is read_csv2() which uses ; for separators instead of ,.

---
# Reading data: readr
```{r}
#Example 
#data with wine evaluations
library(readr)
data <- read_csv("data/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")
data
```

---
# Reading data: readxl

## Features

* No external dependency on, e.g., Java or Perl.

* Re-encodes non-ASCII characters to UTF-8.

* Loads datetimes into POSIXct columns. Both Windows (1900) and Mac (1904) 
  date specifications are processed correctly.

* Discovers the minimal data rectangle and returns that, by default. User can exert more control with `range`, `skip`, and `n_max`.

* Column names and types are determined from the data in the sheet, by default. User can also supply via `col_names` and `col_types`.

* Returns a [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/reference/tibble.html), i.e. a data frame with an additional `tbl_df` class. Among other things, this provide nicer printing.

---
# Other relevant packages

Here are some other packages with functionality that is complementary to readxl and that also avoid a Java dependency.

* [openxlsx](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=openxlsx) provides "a high level interface to writing, styling and editing worksheets".

```{r eval = FALSE}
l <- list(iris = iris, mtcars = mtcars, chickwts = chickwts, quakes = quakes)
openxlsx::write.xlsx(l, file = "datasets.xlsx")
```

* [writexl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=writexl) It's a portable and lightweight way to export a data frame to xlsx, based on [libxlsxwriter](https://github.com/jmcnamara/libxlsxwriter). It is much more minimalistic than openxlsx, but on simple examples, appears to be about twice as fast and to write smaller files.

* [tidyxl](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyxl) is focused on importing awkward and non-tabular data from Excel. It also "exposes cell content, position and formatting in a tidy structure for further manipulation".

# Data transformation

---
background-image: url(img/dplyr.jpg)

---
## Data manipulation with dplyr

Following dplyr's github page, its main goals are:

- Identify the most important data manipulation tools needed for data analysis and make them easy to use in R.

- Provide blazing fast performance for in-memory data by writing key pieces of code in C++.

- Use the same code interface to work with data no matter where it's stored, whether in a data frame, a data table or database.

---
## Support

The key object in dplyr is a tibble, a representation of a tabular data structure. Currently dplyr supports:

- tibbles
- data frames
- data tables
- SQLite
- PostgreSQL/Redshift
- MySQL/MariaDB
- Bigquery
- MonetDB
- Presto
- data cubes with arrays (partial implementation)

---
## The main verbs

- `select()`: selects a subset of variables
- `filter()`: selects a subset of observations
- `mutate()`: adds new variables
- `summarise()`: reduces a group(s) to a smaller number of values (e.g., summary statistics)
- `arrange()`: re-orders observations


## Special cases
- `rename()`: similar to `select()` but keeps all columns that you didn’t specifically mention
- `transmute()`: similar to `mutate()` but drops all columns that you didn’t specifically mention

---
## Other verbs
- `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()` to take random samples.
- `distinct()`: returns distinct (unique) rows of a table
- `slice()`: allows you to select rows by position. It includes positive integers and drops negative integers
- `do()`: A generic function that applies any R function to specified groups in the data.

With all these verbs you can use grouped operations with the function `group_by()`

---
## Multiple tables verbs

dplyr implements the four most useful SQL joins:

- `inner_join(x, y)`: matching x + y
- `left_join(x, y)`: all x + matching y
- `semi_join(x, y)`: all x with match in y
- `anti_join(x, y)`: all x without match in y

And provides methods for:

- `intersect(x, y)`: all rows in both x and y
- `union(x, y)`: rows in either x or y
- `setdiff(x, y)`: rows in x, but not y

---
## Examples

Let's play with our wine to show some examples of dplyr verbs

```{r, cache=TRUE}
View(data)
```

---
## The select() verb:
```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country, points, price, title:winery)
```

---
## Special functions

`select()` and `rename()` allows existing functions like `:` and `c`, or the use of special functions:
  
- `starts_with(x)`: names starts with x

- `ends_with(x)`: names ends in x

- `contains(x)`: selects all variables whose name contains x

- `matches(x)`: selects all variables whose name matches the regular expression x

- `num_range("x", 1:5, width = 2)`: selects all variables (numerically) from x01 to x05.

- `one_of("x", "y", "z")`: selects variables provided in a character vector.

- `everything()`: selects all variables.

- To drop variables, use `-variable`

---
## Some examples with select()

```{r}
data <- data %>% 
  select(-X1)
data
```

---
## Some examples with select()
  
```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country:points)
```

---
## Some examples with select()

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(starts_with("taster"))
```

---
## Some examples with select()

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(contains("twitter"))
```

---
## How to change names
Remember we have the following variables in our data
```{r}
names(data)
```

---
## Renaming
With `select()` we can rename variables but those not mentioned are dropped
```{r}
data %>% select(taster_twitter = taster_twitter_handle)
```

---
## The rename() verb
Using `rename()` we can keep all variables
```{r}
data %>% rename(taster_twitter = taster_twitter_handle)
```

# By the way...

# Scoped variants

### There are three kinds of scoped variants of dplyr verbs. 

  
- Verbs suffixed with _all() apply an operation on all variables.

- Verbs suffixed with _at() apply an operation on a subset of variables specified with the quoting function vars(). This quoting function accepts tidyselect::vars_select() helpers like starts_with(). Instead of a vars() selection, you can also supply an integerish vector of column positions or a character vector of column names.

- Verbs suffixed with _if() apply an operation on the subset of variables for which a predicate function returns TRUE. Instead of a predicate function, you can also supply a logical vector.

---
background-image: url(img/scoped.gif)

---
# Example
```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}

data %>% select_if(is_numeric)
```

---
## The slice() verb

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country, title, points, price) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

---
## The arrange() verb
  
```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country, title, points, price) %>% 
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  arrange(-price)
```

---
## The distinct() verb

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country, province) %>% 
  distinct()
```

---
## The mutate() verb

We use `mutate` to modify a column.

```{r}
data <- data %>%
  mutate(price_per_point = price/points, 
         ppp2 = price_per_point*100) #Notice that we can apply sequential transformations 
data %>% 
  select(points, price, price_per_point, ppp2) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```

---
## Equivalently, we can use the transmute() verb:

```{r}
data %>% 
  transmute(price_per_point = price/points)
```

---
## mutate example: Logical expressions

```{r}
data <- data %>% 
  mutate(price_range = ifelse(price_per_point>mean(price_per_point, na.rm=T),"High","Low"))

data %>%
  select(price_range, price_per_point)
```

---
## What if we want to transform more than one variable at a time?

```{r}
data %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, list(~./100)) %>% 
  select_if(is.numeric)
```

---
## The filter() verb

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(country=="Chile")
```

---
## Chile is great, but how many possible options do we have?

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  distinct()
```

---
## Or

```{r}
data %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  pull()
```

---
## or just
```{r}
data$country %>% unique()
```

---
## The filter() verb

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(country == "Chile",
         price_range == "High")
```

---
## The filter() verb

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(country == "Chile",
         price > 20)
```

---
## The summarise() verb

```{r}
data %>% 
  filter(country == "Chile",
         price_range == "High") %>% 
  summarise(price = mean(price, na.rm = T))
```

---
## Grouped operations: group_by()

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(country)
```

---
## group_by() is useful when combined with the verbs:

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = T))
```

*Exercise:* Filter out the rows where Country is missing and recalculate the group_by and mean.


---
## group by several variables:

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(country, price_range) %>% 
  summarise(mean_price = mean(price, na.rm = T))
```

---
## Notice that with each aggregation we are ungrouping one level:

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(country, province, region_1, region_2) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  summarise(n=sum(n))
  
```

---
## Notice that with each aggregation we are ungrouping one level:

```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(country, province, region_1, region_2)%>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  summarise(n=sum(n)) %>% 
  summarise(n=sum(n)) %>% 
  summarise(n = sum(n))
```

---
## We can ungroup the data manually too:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data %>% 
  group_by(country, province, region_1, region_2)%>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  ungroup() 
```

---
## And speaking about n()

As you saw before, `n()` allows to count the number of rows in a current group. There are related functions worth to know:

* tally() is a convenient wrapper for summarise that will either call n() or sum(n) depending on whether you're tallying for the first time, or re-tallying. 
* count() is similar but calls group_by() before and ungroup() after.
* add_tally() adds a column "n" to a table based on the number of items within each existing group, 
* add_count() is a shortcut that does the grouping as well. 

---
```{r}
data %>% 
  group_by(country, province, region_1, region_2)%>% 
  tally()
```

---
```{r}
data %>% 
  count(country, province, region_1, region_2)
```

# Data tidying
![](img/tidy.gif)

---
background-image: url(img/tidyr.jpg)

---
## Tidying data: tidyr

`tidyr`: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.

Tidy data:

* Each variable must have its own column.
* Each observation must have its own row.
* Each value must have its own cell.

---
## tidyr

Tidyr provides the following verbs:

- Pivotting” which converts between long and wide forms: pivot_longer() and pivot_wider()

- “Rectangling”, which turns deeply nested lists (as from JSON) into tidy tibbles: unnest_longer(), unnest_wider(), hoist(). Check vignette("rectangle") for more details.

- Nesting converts grouped data to a form where each group becomes a single row containing a nested data frame, and unnesting does the opposite. See nest(), unnest(), and vignette("nest") for more details.

- Splitting and combining character columns. Use separate() and extract() to pull a single character column into multiple columns; use unite() to combine multiple columns into a single character column.

- Make implicit missing values explicit with complete(); make explicit missing values implicit with drop_na(); replace missing values with next/previous value with fill(), or a known value with replace_na().

---
# Pivotting

There are two fundamental verbs of pivotting:

- `pivot_longer()` takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs: it makes "wide" data longer.

- `pivot_wider()` takes two columns (key & value) and spreads in to multiple columns, it makes "long" data wider.

---
## tidyr example
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
data %>% 
  group_by(country, variety) %>% 
  summarise(points = mean(points, na.rm = T))
```

---
## tidyr example
```{r, message=FALSE}
data2 <- data %>% 
  group_by(country, variety) %>% 
  summarise(points = mean(points, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = variety, values_from = points)
data2
```

---
## And inversely
```{r}
data3 <- data2 %>% 
  pivot_longer(-country, names_to = "variety", values_to = "points") #It also accepts select functions...
data3
```

---
## unite()
```{r}
data3 <- data3 %>% 
  unite(country_variety, country, variety, remove=FALSE) 
data3
```

---
## separate()
```{r}
data3 %>% 
  separate(country_variety, c("country", "variety"), sep = "_")
```

--
What was the problem here? How to solve it?

---
## Other tidyr verbs:

- `complete()` Complete a data frame with missing combinations of data.

- `drop_na()` Drop rows containing missing values

- `expand(), crossing(), nesting()` Expand data frame to include all combinations of values

- `fill()` Fill in missing values.

- `full_seq()` Create the full sequence of values in a vector.

- `replace_na()` Replace missing values
